              As the Head of Engineering for Cloud Platform and SRE at a
              venerable UK retail institution with a rich history spanning
              nearly 150 years, I lead the Platform and SRE team supporting a
              dynamic tech function of over 300 tech professionals. Our
              transformative journey has restructured the tech landscape,
              aligning with business-centric product verticals. Embracing a
              "build first" mentality, we prioritise customisation over
              off-the-shelf solutions. Guided by our four core goals in
              Platform—Make it Possible, Make it Safe, Make it Easy, and Make it
              Better—we've crafted a world-class platform. Yet, our journey
              continues with exciting work on the horizon.
